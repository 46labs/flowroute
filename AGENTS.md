## Project

Mock of the Flowroute Messaging API (v2.1, v2.2) for local development and tests. Serves send and MDR lookup, posts inbound messages and delivery receipts to callbacks with Flowroute's retry behaviour, and exposes a `/mock` control API.

## Architecture

`cmd/main.go` loads config (`pkg/config`, viper, `config.yaml` and env) and serves `pkg/server`. State is in memory. Callbacks run in goroutines bound to the server context; `Server.Wait` drains them.

## Setup

```bash
go mod download
```

## Run

```bash
just run      # go run on :8080
just docker   # image on :8080
```

## Test

```bash
just ci
```

## Principles

- Library-first: prefer existing packages over custom implementations. Review for duplication.
- No code without a plan. Investigation and implementation are separate steps.
- Own the problem. Never dismiss environment issues.
- Research before action: check current best practices and latest stable versions before making changes.
- Run linters and tests before completing work.

## Code Conventions

### Git

- Feature branches from main: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `hotfix/`
- Never commit to main. Never push without explicit ask.
- Conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`
- Single line, concise, imperative subjects.
- No Co-Authored-By trailers.
- Squash merge preferred.

### Testing

- Great test coverage is a goal, not an afterthought.
- Testcontainers for integration tests where applicable.
- No sleep-based timing in tests.

### Frontend Design

For any UI work (components, pages, landing, dashboards), use the universal `impeccable` skill for the design pass before writing implementation code. Install via `npx skills add pbakaus/impeccable -g`. Project context lives in `PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md` at the repo root; run `impeccable teach` and `impeccable document` once per project to scaffold them.

Subcommands: `craft` (new UI), `shape` (refine), `audit` (review), `live` (browser iteration).

## README Policy

- For human consumption. Concise. No em-dashes. No AI prose.
- Content: what it is, how to set up, how to run, how to test.
- Mermaid diagrams where they help.
- Refreshed at end of implementation cycles before push.

## Specs & Plans

- Design specs: `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Implementation plans: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Review Protocol

Specs use a Claude-orchestrated review cycle. Claude owns the document; other agents (Codex, etc.) are invoked as review oracles.

- Claude drafts and holds the spec. Codex is called via `codex exec` for scoped review passes.
- Codex returns assessments; Claude integrates them. Only Claude writes to disk.
- Marker blocks (git merge conflict syntax with `|||` threads) are **preserved in the final doc** as decision records — they are not stripped on finalize.
- Vocabulary: `||| agent [action]` where action is `gap`, `recommend`, `question`, `accept`, `accept-partial`, `reject`, or `edit`.
- Bottom block (between `=======` and `>>>>>>>`) is the final agreed content. Sign-off line: `>>>>>>> claude` (solo) or `>>>>>>> claude+codex` (joint).
- Record a block when codex input materially changed the outcome. Skip for trivial confirmations.
- `## Decisions` section indexes choices: flat bullets for solo/confirmed, marker blocks for cross-agent influenced.

### Conflict-Marker Tooling

Final specs and plans intentionally contain markers. Exclude these paths from conflict-marker checks:

- **Pre-commit**: exclude `docs/specs/**` and `docs/plans/**` on conflict-marker hooks
- **CI**: same path exclusion on grep/lint steps that detect `<<<<<<<`
- **Editor**: suppress merge-conflict warnings for these paths

## Reference Files

- When project instructions point to local reference files or folders, resolve relative paths from the file that mentions them first.
- Read only the reference files relevant to the current task. Do not load an entire reference tree by default.
- Treat reference files as supporting context. Validate version-specific behavior against the active project code, config, and installed tool versions.
